// Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

var Letter = function(isInWord=false, guessLetter) {
    

    // this is an alternate example of defining isInWord = false;
   // this.isInWord=isInWord || false;

   
  

// A string value to store the underlying character for the letter

this.guessLetter = guessLetter;


// A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

this.isInWord = isInWord

// A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed

this.toString = function () {

  if (this.guessLetter === " ") {
      this.isInWord = true;
      return " ";
  } else {
      if (this.isInWord === false) {
          return "_";
      } else {
          return this.guessLetter;
      }
  }

// A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly

function() {

}

};

module.exports = Letter;
